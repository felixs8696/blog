**Problem to solve**

<!-- RL is notoriously hi
Store state actions in Experience Replay Memory
- Method
	- Batch or randomly sample data from different time steps
- Benefits
	- Reduces variance in data encountered by an online RL agent
	- Decorrelates updates
- Issues
	- More meory and computation per itneraction
	- Requires off-policy RL algorithms that can update from data generated by older policies
