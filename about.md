Hey, I'm Felix. I'm a Robotics AI software engineer at Amazon and a recent graduate of UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science. Even after starting a <a href="https://callaunchpad.org" target="_blank">machine learning club in college</a> and working on incredible things at work, I still struggle daily to understand things people much smarter than me seem to pick up instantly. So, from one struggling student to another, I hope that, by letting me struggle to untangle the complicated parts of machine learning, you might not lose so much hair doing so yourself.

Happy reading :)
